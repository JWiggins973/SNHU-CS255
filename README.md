# SNHU-CS255
This is my reflection and final project done in this course

#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Liam the owner of DriverPass wants to create a system to help students be better prepared for their driving exam by providing online resources and hands on training.

#What did you do particularly well?

For this assignment, I believe my best work was during the planning phase, particularly in creating the Gantt chart to visualize the project timeline. The different phases are color-coded, making it easy to read and understand. I also did a great job on the various UML diagrams, as each one clearly represents the use cases and overall system functionality, allowing viewers to quickly grasp the system’s structure and purpose.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part of the assignment I would revise is the Use Case Diagram because it appears too complex and slightly cluttered, making it difficult to read and interpret. To improve it, I would combine certain system functionalities—such as Book Lesson, Book Test, and Book Online Class—into a single use case like “Choose Course Type”, which would also include “Pay for Lesson.” This revision would simplify the diagram while still clearly representing the system’s intended functionality.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user’s needs were interpreted and implemented into the system design by first conducting an in-person interview with the owner, Liam. During the interview, clear, open-ended questions were asked, and notes were taken to ensure the team could reference key points during the planning phase.
Considering the user’s needs is essential because it ensures the system is usable, efficient, and aligned with expectations. If the design doesn’t prioritize user experience, the system may fail to meet its intended purpose.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Way i approach designing software is to follow the SDLC, which means to first gather the requirements and undertsand them, next plan, which entails defining the scope, dependecies and identifying potential challenges. Next diagrams are created to visulaize the systems structure and interactions. Afterwards the approiate system architecture is choosen, and when that's complete developemnt and testing can begin.

Strategies I plan to use in the future to analyze and design a system include Gantt charts to visualize the project timeline, UML diagrams (use case, sequence, and activity) to illustrate the system’s overall structure and interactions, and non-technical language when presenting ideas to stakeholders to ensure clarity and understanding for an audience with little to no technical background. Additionally, I plan to utilize Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to depict the inputs, outputs, and data flow of a system, as well as decompose main processes into smaller subprocesses for a more detailed view.
